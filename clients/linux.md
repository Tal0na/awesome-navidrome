(English) Best Linux clients for Navidrome

- **Navidrome Web UI (browser)** — FOSS. Recommended: use any modern browser for full functionality.
- **Subsonic-compatible desktop players** — Various FOSS and paid players exist for Linux (e.g., native Linux builds or AppImages); check project pages for license details.
- **Command-line & native music players** — While not Navidrome-specific, some players can stream from Subsonic-compatible servers using plugins or wrappers.

Notes:

- I couldn't fully verify the current licensing/pricing for every client; please confirm before publishing.
